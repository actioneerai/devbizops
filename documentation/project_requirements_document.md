# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

DevBizOps Powered by AI is built for technical startup founders who need to bridge the gap between deep technical work and fast-paced business growth. This platform brings together your code repositories, deployment pipelines, project management tools, CRM systems, and communication channels into one unified dashboard. Its purpose is to ensure that every line of code you write has a direct, measurable impact on your business outcomes, turning your technical feats into investor-ready dashboards and actionable business insights.

The project is being built because technical founders often find themselves torn between building a brilliant product and managing the business side of things. With AI agents acting as a bridge between sales calls, coding efforts, and business metric tracking, founders can focus on what they do best without wasting time on miscommunication. Key objectives include seamlessly integrating technical and business data, automating artifact generation from meetings, and creating a real-time dashboard that maps technical progress to user adoption and revenue growth.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   Integrated platform that unifies technical and business data sources (GitHub, CI/CD pipelines, Jira, CRM systems, Slack/Discord, etc.).
*   Autonomous AI agents (e.g., TechTranslator Agent, RoadmapAgent, InvestorDashboardAgent, PMFAgent) that capture and translate in-real-time meetings and technical data.
*   A unified dashboard presenting real-time visualizations linking code deployments to business metrics such as customer acquisition, revenue impact, and investor-ready insights.
*   Role-based access control with robust security measures to manage who sees what data depending on their role (founders, developers, product managers, business analysts, sales).
*   Customizable user interface that allows both a sensible default layout and configurable widgets for key performance indicators.
*   Integration of third-party tools such as GitHub, Slack, Discord, Salesforce, Jenkins, and others based on user feedback.
*   Real-time data ingestion and immediate artifact generation (e.g., investor update reports) during meetings.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Developing an extensive enterprise-grade ERP system beyond the core functionality of aligning technical and business workflows.
*   Full-scale mobile application development outside a mobile-first dashboard design for on-the-go access.
*   Custom integrations for every possible third-party tool out there – the focus will be on popular platforms used by startups.
*   Excessively complex customization of dashboards that might overwhelm a busy founder; the initial version will stick with essential, high-impact features.
*   Advanced analytics or machine learning predictions beyond converting technical data into investor presentations and operational insights.

## 3. User Flow

A new user starts by signing up via email or using a single sign-on option. After entering basic information, they are welcomed with a short onboarding tour that explains the platform’s dual focus on technical excellence and business growth. The onboarding process helps users set up their profile, choose their role (founder, developer, product manager, or business analyst), and configure their notification preferences so that the dashboard is tailored to their exact needs.

Once onboard, the user is taken to a unified dashboard. In this view, the left sidebar allows navigation between various AI agent modules and different data sources, while the main area displays crucial technical metrics alongside business KPIs. During live interactions, such as sales meetings or team calls, AI agents like the TechTranslator Agent automatically capture conversations and update the dashboard with actionable items. After the meeting, the user can review detailed visualizations of how recent code deployments correlate with business outcomes such as user adoption, customer acquisition, and revenue impact.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:** The system must operate with low latency during live meetings and data ingestion. Data visualizations and AI artifact generation should happen nearly instantaneously.
*   **Scalability:** Able to handle multiple simultaneous users and high volumes of data from various sources without degrading performance.
*   **Security:** Strict role-based access control, encryption protocols for handling sensitive data, and regular audits to ensure GDPR, CCPA, or other industry-specific compliance.
*   **Usability:** A user-friendly interface that requires minimal training; intuitive onboarding and a default dashboard layout designed for busy startup founders.
*   **Availability:** High system uptime and resilient real-time data feeds, especially during critical live interactions.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   The system depends on real-time data feeds and integrations with external APIs (e.g., GitHub, CRM systems, Slack, Discord), so changes or downtimes on these services can affect performance.
*   We assume that technical founders and their teams are familiar with both coding and basic business metrics.
*   The first MVP will use popular and widely adopted third-party platforms; extensive custom integrations may be added later.
*   Access control must be finely tuned; sensitive cross-domain data (e.g., linking code metrics directly to revenue) will require additional layers of security.
*   Performance requirements (low latency, high availability) assume appropriate scalability measures on cloud infrastructure.
*   Some features like advanced analytics or extensive dashboard customization will be limited in the initial release to keep the system simple and focused.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **Data Integration Challenges:** Merging data from diverse sources like GitHub, Jira, and Salesforce may face issues such as API rate limits or inconsistent data formats. Mitigation: Use robust data transformation layers and caching mechanisms.
*   **Real-Time Processing Demands:** Achieving low latency during live meetings while processing AI agent tasks is challenging. Mitigation: Optimize AI models and consider load balancing strategies on the backend.
*   **Over-Customization Risks:** Allowing too many dashboard customizations might overwhelm users. Mitigation: Provide a strong default layout and limited customization options in the MVP.
*   **Access Control Complexity:** Ensuring that sensitive, cross-domain data is only accessible to authorized users might lead to configuration errors. Mitigation: Implement detailed audit trails and regular security reviews.
*   **Reliance on Third-Party Tools:** Any downtime or API changes from integrated services (Slack, GitHub, CI/CD systems) could impact the platform. Mitigation: Build robust error handling and fallback strategies.
