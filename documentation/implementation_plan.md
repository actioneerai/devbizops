# Implementation plan

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1.  Install Node.js v20.2.1 (as used in similar projects) and verify installation by running `node -v` (Tech Stack: Backend).
2.  Install PostgreSQL 15.3 via Docker with the command:

`docker run --name devbizops-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword -d postgres:15.3 `(Tech Stack: Database).

1.  Initialize a Git repository in the project root; create and protect `main` and `dev` branches (Project Goal: Unified repo structure).

2.  Create the following directory structure in the project root:

    *   `/frontend`
    *   `/backend`
    *   `/docs` (Project Goal: Unified repo structure).

3.  Configure a basic `package.json` in the project root to manage project dependencies (Tech Stack: Core Tools).

4.  **Validation**: Run `node -v` and `docker ps` to ensure Node.js and PostgreSQL are correctly running.

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

1.  Initialize a new React project inside `/frontend` using Create React App:

`npx create-react-app . `(Tech Stack: Frontend, Project Goal: Mobile-first design).

1.  Install Tailwind CSS by following Tailwindâ€™s installation guide and create a `tailwind.config.js` file in `/frontend` (Tech Stack: Frontend, Visual Design: Clean and modern).
2.  Create a main dashboard component at `/frontend/src/components/Dashboard.js` that will serve as the Unified Dashboard (Core Features: Unified Dashboard).
3.  Create a widget component at `/frontend/src/components/Widget.js` for displaying customizable metrics (Core Features: Customizable widgets).
4.  Create an AI Agent panel component at `/frontend/src/components/AgentPanel.js` to trigger and display results from AI agents (Core Features: AI Agents).
5.  Implement mobile-first responsive design in `Dashboard.js` using Tailwind CSS classes (Non-Functional Requirements: Usability, Mobile-first design).
6.  Set up React Router for navigation and create routes for the dashboard and settings pages (Key Workflows: User navigation).
7.  **Validation**: Run the React development server with `npm start` and verify that the dashboard and widget components display correctly on both desktop and mobile.

## Phase 3: Backend Development

1.  Initialize a new Node.js Express project inside `/backend` by running `npm init -y` (Tech Stack: Backend).
2.  Create the main server file at `/backend/app.js` and set up the Express server (Tech Stack: Backend).
3.  Configure Express middleware for JSON parsing by adding `app.use(express.json())` in `/backend/app.js` (Best Practices: Data handling).
4.  Create a JWT authentication middleware at `/backend/middleware/auth.js` to secure API endpoints (Core Features: Access Control, Auth: JWT).
5.  Create an API route for the Unified Dashboard at `/backend/routes/dashboard.js` to deliver dashboard data (Core Features: Unified Dashboard).
6.  Create API routes for AI Agents at `/backend/routes/aiagents.js` including endpoints for TechTranslator, RoadmapAgent, InvestorDashboardAgent, and PMFAgent (Core Features: AI Agents, MVP Priority noted for TechTranslator).
7.  Create API endpoints for data integration with external systems (GitHub, CI/CD, Jira, CRM, Slack, Discord) at `/backend/routes/integrations.js` (Core Features: Data Integration).
8.  Create a PostgreSQL connection file at `/backend/config/db.js` using environment variables for secure credentials (Tech Stack: Database).
9.  Write sample SQL queries in `/backend/config/db.js` to fetch technical and business metrics (Project Goal: Connecting code to business outcomes).
10. Configure Express error-handling middleware within `/backend/app.js` to manage runtime exceptions (Non-Functional Requirements: Robustness).
11. Install necessary Node modules such as Express, jsonwebtoken, and pg by running `npm install express jsonwebtoken pg` (Tech Stack: Backend).
12. Create further integration logic in `/backend/routes/integrations.js` to handle data transformation between systems (Risks & Mitigation: Data integration challenges).
13. **Validation**: Test the dashboard endpoint using `curl http://localhost:<PORT>/api/dashboard` and confirm an appropriate JSON response.

## Phase 4: Integration

1.  In the frontend, create a service file at `/frontend/src/services/api.js` to handle all Axios HTTP requests (Key Workflows: Integration between frontend & backend).
2.  Connect the `Dashboard` component to the `/api/dashboard` endpoint via Axios in `/frontend/src/services/api.js` (Core Features: Unified Dashboard).
3.  Connect the `AgentPanel` component to the `/api/aiagents` endpoint to fetch AI agent responses (Core Features: AI Agents).
4.  Implement JWT authentication handling in the frontend by storing tokens in `localStorage` and adding them to API request headers (Core Features: Access Control).
5.  Design and implement an error and network handling notification component at `/frontend/src/components/Notification.js` for user feedback (Non-Functional Requirements: Usability).
6.  **Validation**: Confirm API data flow by reviewing browser console logs and ensuring that API calls return valid responses and update the UI.

## Phase 5: Deployment

1.  Create a Jenkins pipeline script at `/jenkins/Jenkinsfile` to automate building, testing, and deployment (Cloud/DevOps: Jenkins CI/CD).
2.  Add build commands in the Jenkinsfile for the frontend using `npm run build` (Tech Stack: Frontend).
3.  Configure an AWS S3 bucket named `devbizops-frontend` in the `us-east-1` region for deploying the static frontend build (Cloud/DevOps: AWS S3).
4.  Update the Jenkinsfile with AWS CLI commands to upload the contents of the `/frontend/build` directory to the S3 bucket (Tech Stack: Deployment).
5.  Create a `Dockerfile` in `/backend` to containerize the Node.js Express application (Cloud/DevOps: Docker, Backend deployment).
6.  Add Docker build and push commands to the Jenkinsfile to deploy the backend container (Cloud/DevOps: Jenkins, Deployment).
7.  Set up environment variables and secure credentials (DB connection strings, JWT secret) for production use in the Jenkinsfile and backend configuration (Security & Compliance: Robust access control, encryption).
8.  Configure HTTPS support and obtain necessary SSL certificates (Security & Compliance: Encryption protocols).
9.  **Validation**: Use end-to-end tests (via Postman or automated test scripts) to ensure that both frontend and backend are functioning as expected in the deployed environment.

## Additional Steps for AI Agents Integration

1.  Implement an AI integration service at `/backend/services/aiIntegration.js` that wraps calls to GPT 4o and Claude 3.7 Sonnet using their API keys (Core Features: AI Agents).
2.  Update the `/backend/routes/aiagents.js` file to call functions from the AI integration service, translating user inputs into actionable data (Core Features: AI Agents).
3.  Create utility functions in `/backend/services/aiIntegration.js` to map AI responses into dashboard-friendly metrics (Project Goal: Direct impact of code on business outcomes).
4.  **Validation**: Test individual AI agent endpoints using Postman with sample payloads and verify the transformed response data.

## Additional Steps for Role-Based Access Control & Customization

1.  Implement a role-based permission middleware at `/backend/middleware/roleCheck.js` enforcing roles (founders, engineers, sales) for protected endpoints (Security & Compliance: Role-based access).
2.  Apply the role-based middleware to sensitive routes such as `/api/dashboard` and `/api/settings` (Core Features: Access Control).
3.  In the frontend, create a Settings page at `/frontend/src/pages/Settings.js` allowing users to configure widget layout and priority metrics (Customization: Sensible default layout with user configuration).
4.  Create an API endpoint at `/backend/routes/settings.js` to save and retrieve user dashboard configurations, and integrate this with the Settings page (Core Features: Unified Dashboard, Customization).

**Validation**: After making changes on the Settings page, verify that user configurations persist by refreshing the dashboard and checking if the layout remains as saved.

This step-by-step implementation plan directly addresses the technical and business objectives outlined in the project summary. Each step cites the corresponding project document segment and ensures a clear integration between technical and business domains.
