11. **Validation**: Test the dashboard endpoint using `curl http://localhost:<PORT>/api/dashboard` and confirm an appropriate JSON response.

## Phase 5: Integration (Planned)

1.  In the frontend, create a service file at `/frontend/src/services/api.js` to handle all HTTP requests to the backend API (Key Workflows: Integration between frontend & backend).
